A repository containing the C++ programming assignments created for my Computer Science 102: Data Structures course.  
The complexity and difficulty of the assignments increases chronologically.

### Brief Description of Assignments
  1. PA1 - Making a simple social network using GML
  2. PA2 - Builds off of PA1, implementing a betweenness centrality algorithm to identify central, or popular, users.
  3. PA3 - A simple 8- or 15- puzzle (puzzle size can vary if desired) sliding tile game, with cheating algorithm.
  4. PA4 - Build off of PA3, adding a front end interface (instead of text output) using Qt.
  5. PA5 - A side scroller video game.
  6. PA6 - Builds off of PA5, adding artificial intelligence objects, a high score list, and varying levels.
